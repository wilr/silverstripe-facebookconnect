# Facebook Connect Integration Module

## Maintainer Contact 
 * Will Rossiter 
   <will (at) fullscreen (dot) io>
	
## Requirements
 * SilverStripe 2.4 or newer.

## Overview
The module provides a **basic** interface for implementing Facebook connect on a website. Facebook connect allows users to login to your website
using their Facebook account. This module integrates that single sign-on within the existing SilverStripe member system.

This has been designed to use the Javascript SDK rather than the OAuth interface.

### What it provides

 * Loads and setups Facebook Connect for Single Sign on via the Javascript SDK

 * Authenticates users visiting the site - if they are logged into Facebook then you can access their information via
   the following controls. You can also optionally set whether to save visitors information as members on your site
   (for example if you need to cache their information)
	
   If you haven't disabled the FacebookConnect::$create_member variable you can access the Facebook's member information
   by using:

    ```
	<% control CurrentMember %>
		$FirstName $LastName $Avatar(small)
	<% end_control %>
	```

   If you have disabled the creation of members you can use the Facebook specific member control. This still returns a 
   member object the only difference is that it won't save the information to the database

    ```
	<% control CurrentFacebookMember %>
		$FirstName $LastName $Avatar(small)
	<% end_control %>
    ```
	
### What it does not provide (yet)

  * This current iteration only provides the backbone. In future updates I am aiming to integrate things like publishing
    stories to a users wall, interacting with events, groups and other things like friends.

  * More controls over the logged in members information (eg status updates, events, groups). If you need this functionality you
	can build this on top of the Facebook API which is exposed:

    ```php
	function foo() {
		// returns the likes		
		$likes = $this->getFacebook()->api('/me/likes');
	}
    ```
	
### How to use

  * To setup Facebook connect your first need to download this and put it in your SilverStripe sites root folder. 
  * You need to register your website / application at http://developers.facebook.com/setup
  * Once you have registered your app set the following in your mysite/_config.php file. Replace the values with the ones
    you should get after registering your app.

    ```php
    FacebookConnect::set_app_id('app-id');
    FacebookConnect::set_api_secret('api-secret');
    FacebookConnect::set_lang('en_US');
    ```

  * Update the database by running `/dev/build` to add the additional fields to the `Member` table.

  * Include the `ConnectInit.ss` template in the `<body>` part of every site you wish to call a Facebook function. This includes the Facebook JavaScript SDK. E.g. on `FrontendPage.ss`

    ```
    <body>
        <% include ConnectInit %>
    ```

Once you have done that you should be able to use the includes provided in this module.

```
<% if CurrentFacebookMember %>
	<p>Hi $CurrentFacebookMember.FirstName</p>
	<% include ConnectLogout %>
<% else %>
	<% include ConnectLogin %>
<% end_if %>
```

You can also access the Facebook member information in your PHP code. The Facebook API connection and current member are
cached on the controller object. So for example if this is in your Page_Controller class

```php
// returns the current facebook member (wrapped in a SS Member Object)	
$this->getCurrentFacebookMember();

// returns the API connection which you can use to write your own query
$this->getFacebook(); 
```
